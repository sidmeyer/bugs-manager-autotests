# bugs-manager-autotests

## Requirements
* Java 8
* Maven
* Google Chrome (tested with 65.0.3325.181 64-bit)
* ChromeDriver (tested with 2.37.544315)

## Quick start
1. Specify path to chromedriver in `webdriver.chrome.driver` property in `pom.xml`
2. `mvn clean verify thucydides:aggregate -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true`
3. See test reports in `target/site/thucydides/index.html`

## Notes
* Test methods have names_with_underscores according to the Thucydides practice.
* XPath selectors are dependent on elements text because the app doesn't have static non-autogenerated ids.
